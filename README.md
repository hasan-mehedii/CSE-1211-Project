## üìú About the Project

This project recreates the timeless Snake game, where players control a snake that grows longer by consuming food items while avoiding collisions with itself and screen borders. It runs offline in single-player mode, keeping a record of player history and the highest score.

## üöÄ How to Run the Game

1. **Install SDL2 and Dependencies**: Ensure SDL2, SDL2_ttf, and SDL2_image are installed on your system. You can download it from [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) or if you are using Linux or Ubuntu as operationg system, you can type about installation of it in terminal. For example:
   ```sh
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
3. **Compile the Code**: Use a C++ compiler with SDL2 linked. For example:
   ```sh
   g++ -o main main.cpp -lSDL2 -lSDL2_ttf -lSDL2_image
4. **Run Code**: Same as a typical C++ code. For example:
   ```sh
   ./main

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **C++ Compiler** (e.g., GCC or MSVC)
- **SDL2 Library** installed (along with `SDL2_ttf` and `SDL2_image` if used). You can download it from [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/)

### Running the Game
1. **Clone the repository or download the source code.**
   
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hasan-mehedii/CSE-1211-Project
    cd CSE-1211-Project
2. **Ensure SDL2 is properly installed.**
 
   ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev
3. **Compile the project** using your C++ compiler. For example:

   ```bash
   g++ -o main main.cpp -lSDL2 -lSDL2_ttf -lSDL2_image

 4. **Run**

    ```bash
    ./main
