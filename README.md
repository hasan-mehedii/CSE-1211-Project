# CSE-1211-Project
First Year Second Semester Final Project based of SDL2 Library
This is basically a Snake Game Project which incudes History, Playername input, display the bestscore features.

#About the Project
The project is an execution of a classic Snake game : a snake controlled by players
that grows longer by consuming food items traveling through the screen avoiding
collision with its own body.

#Motivation
The purpose of this project was to use theoretical knowledge of development
libraries and programming languages in a real setting.
I used this project as an introduction to programming language, utilizing
a well-known and entertaining game to explain key topics. The project provided me with an opportunity to learn about interesting knowledge of fundamental concepts in game creation such as collision detection, object-oriented
programming, and game loops.
Again there was a personal ground to build up this game. As we have grown upplaying the classic snake game, I was motivated to recreate it and share thenostalgic experience with a new generation.
